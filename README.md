## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

```css
a, a:visited, a:hover, a:active {
    text-decoration: none;
}

a, a:visited {
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 20%);
    color: white;
}

a:hover, a:active {
    color: hsl(0, 0%, 12%);
    background-color: hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
}
```

I learned about using different states of an element and applying different styles for those particular states.

### Continued development

In further projects, I will keep working on design an color palletes.
